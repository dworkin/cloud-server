void set_suspension_manager(object obj)	[System only]

    Install a suspended callout manager, in which the following functions will
    be called when callouts are suspended:

    * void suspend_callout(object obj, int handle)

	Suspend a callout for an object.

    * int remove_callout(object obj, int handle)

	Remove a suspended callout for an object.  This function should return
	TRUE if the callout was indeed suspended, or FALSE otherwise.

    * void remove_callouts(object obj)

	Remove all suspended callouts for an object.

void suspend_callouts() [suspension manager only]

    Suspend all callouts in the entire system.  Only callouts in the suspension
    manager will still run normally.  This call can be used to suspend all
    activity in a system that has been taken down for maintenance.

void resume_callouts() [suspension manager only]

    Stop suspending callouts.

void release_callout(object obj, int handle) [suspension manager only]

    Release a previously suspended callout.
