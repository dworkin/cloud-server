NAME
	call_out_other - start a callout in another object

SYNOPSIS
	mixed call_out_other(object obj, string function, mixed args...)


DESCRIPTION
	Start a callout in an object.  Only non-private functions can be
	called with call_out_other().  If the function is static, the object
	in which the function is called must be the same as the object from
	which the function is called, or the callout will fail.
	Any additional arguments to call_out_other() will be passed on to the
	called function.

ERRORS
	Calling a function that does not exist, or a function that cannot be
	called with call_out_other() because it is private or static, does
	not result in an error.
