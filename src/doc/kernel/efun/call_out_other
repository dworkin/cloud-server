NAME
	call_out_other - start a callout in another object

SYNOPSIS
	int call_out_other(object obj, string function, mixed delay,
			   mixed args...)


DESCRIPTION
	Start a callout in an object.  Only non-private functions can be
	called with call_out_other().  If the function is static, the object
	in which the function is called must be the current object.
	Apart from the object argument, the arguments are the same as for
	call_out().

ERRORS
	Calling a function that does not exist, or a function that cannot be
	called with call_out_other() because it is private or static, results
	in an error.
